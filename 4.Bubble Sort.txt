Constraints/Assumptions
Works with a list of numbers
Compares index n and n plus 1
Sorts in ascending order
Uses a Boolean to remember if indices were swapped

ALGORITHM TO PERFORM BUBBLE SORT
Enter a set of numbers into a list of floating point numbers
Check to ensure numbers were entered and if not exit program and ask user to enter correct values
Check the length of the list and assign it to an integer variable index which will also be declared
Declare a Boolean variable swapped; initialize its value to be true
Start outer Loop
	While swapped is true
	Let swapped be equal to false
	Start Inner Loop
		Declare a variable n and assign it a value of zero
		A For loop from n equals zero till n equals to index minus one
		Check if the element at index n in the list is greater than the element at index n plus one, if it is, swap the two elements
		Let swapped be equal to true
		Add one to n
		Stop inner loop
Stop Outer Loop
Print the values in the List
Stop
