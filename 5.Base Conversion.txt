CONSTRAINTS/ASSUMPTIONS
It doesn't include numbers with fractions
convert to base ten first and sebsequently to the desired base
Includes cases of wanting to convert straight to base ten and straight from base ten
Same base conversion is not possible
Each digit in a given number should be lower than the base of the number 

ALGORITHM TO CONVERT FROM ONE NUMBER BASE TO ANOTHER	
Start
Declare and enter positive integer variables inputNumber, inputBase and outputBase
Check to ensure they are integer variables, if not end the program and ask user to input correct values
Ensure that inputBase is not equal to outputBase, or else take the user back to the beginning  
Declare an array inputList to hold the conversion of inputNumber to an array
Check that each digit in array is less than inputBase or else take the user back to the beginning
Declare an array remainder to hold remainders from integer division
Check if outputBase is 10, if it is

Declare an integer variable toBase10 to hold the base ten value to be calculated and initialize it as zero
Declare another integer variable position as a counter and buffer and initialize as zero.
Start Loop
	While position is less than the length of inputList
	toBase10 is equal to the summation of itself and the product of multiplication between an element of the array inputList at index position n; and the inputBase raised to the power of the length of inputList subtracting n plus one
Stop Loop
Print toBase10

Check if inputBase is 10, if it is
Declare a buffer variable remainderValue which is an integer
Start Loop
	While inputNumber is greater than zero
	Let remainderValue be equal to the integer division of inputNumber by outputBase
	Store remaindervalue in the array remainder
	Let inputNumber be equal to the normal division of inputNumber by outputBase
Stop Loop
Get the length of the remainder array
Declare a variable printIter which is initialized the length of the remainder array minus one
Start Loop
	While printIter is greater than or equal to zero
	Print the value of the element at the index position of printIter
	Subtract one from printIter
Stop Loop

If the two conditions above donâ€™t hold then,

Declare an integer variable toBase10 to hold the base ten value to be calculated and initialize it as zero
Declare another integer variable position as a counter and buffer and initialize as zero.
Start Loop
	While position is less than the length of inputList
	toBase10 is equal to the summation of itself and the product of multiplication between an element of the array inputList at index position n; and the inputBase raised to the power of the length of inputList subtracting n plus one
Stop Loop

Declare a buffer variable remainderValue which is an integer
Start Loop
	While toBase10 is greater than zero
	Let remainderValue be equal to the integer division of toBase10 by outputBase
	Store remaindervalue in the array remainder
	Let toBase10 be equal to the normal division of toBase10 by outputBase
Stop Loop

Get the length of the remainder array
Declare a variable printIter which is initialized the length of the remainder array minus one
Start Loop
	While printIter is greater than or equal to zero
	Print the value of the element at the index position of printIter
	Subtract one from printIter
Stop Loop
Stop
