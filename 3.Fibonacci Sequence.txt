Constraints/Assumptions
It’s a sequence so it’s a list of numbers
Termination criteria is the number of terms input by a user
The sequence will begin with zero and one
The user must input a positive integer

ALGORITHM TO GET THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
Start
User to input a positive integer number userInput as the number of terms expected in the sequence
Check to ensure that the input is a positive integer, if it’s not exit program and ask user for correct input
Declare an integer list variable fibonacci to hold the list of Fibonacci numbers
Add the values one and zero to the list
Declare an integer variable sequence to calculate each term
Declare an integer variable term and initialize it to one
Start Loop
	While term is less than or equal to userInput
	Let sequence be equal to the sum of elements in fibonacci with their index values as term and term minus one
	Add sequence to the list fibonacci
	print sequence
	Add one to term
Stop Loop
Stop
