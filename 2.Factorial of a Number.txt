Constraints/Assumptions
The product of all the positive integers less than or equal to a given number
We can’t find the factorial of a negative number
We can’t find the factorial of a non-integer number e.g. 5.84
Zero factorial and one factorial are both equal to one

ALGORITHM TO GET THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
Start
Enter a positive integer number factorial
Declare another positive integer buffer to help calculate factorial
Let buffer be equal to factorial minus one
Check that the user entered an integer and prompt them to try again if not
Check if factorial is equal to zero, if it is factorial would be equal to one
If not Start Loop
	While buffer is greater than or equal to one
	Let factorial be equal to factorial multiplied by buffer
	Subtract one from buffer
Stop Loop
Print Factorial
Stop
